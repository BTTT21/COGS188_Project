    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

Unlike toy problems, Minesweeper presents a complex action space with both deterministic logic-based decisions and probabilistic uncertainty, making it a compelling testbed for AI methods.\n",

    "Our AI system will be evaluated using multiple performance metrics, including completion rate, accuracy, and computational efficiency, to identify the most effective combination of techniques. We will also explore hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The results will provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, contributing to a deeper understanding of AI-driven problem-solving in Minesweeper."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Brief Rules:**  \n",
    "In Minesweeper, you are presented with a grid where certain cells hide mines. The objective is to reveal all safe cells without uncovering any mines. When a safe cell is revealed, it displays a number that indicates how many of its adjacent cells contain mines; if the number is zero, a cascade effect automatically reveals its neighboring cells. Players can also flag cells they suspect to contain mines to avoid accidental clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Environment, Actions, Transition, Reward and Goal:**  \n",
    "The game is played on a 16*30 grid with a predetermined number of mines randomly placed at the start. The player interacts with the environment by choosing to reveal a cell at given coordinates or flag/unflag a cell as potentially dangerous. When a cell is revealed, if it is safe, the board updates to show the number of adjacent mines; if that number is zero, it triggers a cascade reveal of neighboring cells. However, revealing a mine immediately ends the game in a loss. The reward structure typically offers small rewards for safe moves and a significant positive reward for successfully uncovering all safe cells (winning), while revealing a mine results in a large negative reward (losing). The overall goal is to strategically reveal every safe cell without triggering any mines, leveraging logical deduction and, when necessary, probabilistic reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Potential Challenges:**  \n",
    "The main challenges include dealing with partial observability, as the true locations of mines remain hidden until revealed, and handling ambiguous situations that may force the player to guess. Additionally, Minesweeper is computationally complex (NP-complete), and the sparse reward structure can make it difficult for algorithmic or learning-based approaches to effectively deduce optimal moves.\n",

Provide enough detail (e.g., algorithmic description and/or theoretical properties) to convince us that your solution is applicable. Why might your solution work? Make sure to describe how the solution will be tested.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you know details already, describe how (e.g., library used, function calls) you plan to implement the solution in a way that is reproducible.\n",

The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",

    "\n",
    "* The win rate will serve as the primary benchmark, measuring the percentage of games won out of the total games played. This metric quantifies the overall success of each AI strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess efficiency, we will use the average game completion time, which calculates the mean duration (in seconds) taken to finish a game, whether won or lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the safe move rate, defined as the percentage of moves that do not result in hitting a mine, will provide insight into the agentâ€™s cautiousness and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the exploration rate will evaluate how thoroughly the AI reveals non-mine tiles, serving as an indicator of its exploration strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these quantifiable metrics will allow for a comprehensive comparison of the performance between the benchmark and proposed AI models, and the best performing model will be our solution model."
